  2. Running the app  
      1. Inside the project folder run - `npm install` (not always- only after git clone). This step will install packages in   local mode inside the project directory. You would see a node_modules folder created which would contain packages.
      2. Run `ionic state restore` (Optional- only once)  
      
      3. Run using __`ionic serve`__ -> Click 'Get All Weddings'  
      This should hit the service and get list of wedding in the db.
